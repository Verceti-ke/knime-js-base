            <p>
                Quick Form node that allows uploading a file and exposing 
                that uploaded file using a flow variable. The value can also be
                controlled from a quick form (web port).
            </p>
        </intro>
        <option name="Label">
          A descriptive label that will be shown in, for instance the web port.

        <option name="Description">
          Some lines of description that will be shown in the remote control 
          form, for instance by means of a tooltip.
        </option>
        <option name="Weight">
          A weight value that influences the position of the component in
          the final layout. Lighter elements will be placed at the top, whereas
          heavier items will be placed nearer the bottom. The value is relative
          to the weights of the other components in the workflow (absolute 
          value is not relevant, only the relative comparison to other
          elements).
        </option>

          Variable identifier.

          file browser (not only the one in the "Default File" option but also
          in a remote file browser), e.g. ".csv,.csv.gz" will filter for
          files ending with ".csv" or ".csv.gz". Leave empty to accept any file.
        </option>
        <option name="Default File">
          The file that will be used during design time, i.e. when no file
          is uploaded by means of the, e.g. KNIME WebPortal.
