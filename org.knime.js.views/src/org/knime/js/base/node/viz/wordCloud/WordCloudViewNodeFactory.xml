    <name>JavaScript Word Cloud</name>
    <shortDescription>Displays a word cloud.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	<p>A word cloud view using JavaScript libraries. The view can be accessed either via
            the "interactive view" action on the executed node or in KNIME Server web portal page.</p>
            <p>The implementation is based on the popular JavaScript library <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> 
            and the layout extension by <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">Jason Davies</a>, which is inspired
            by the popular Java based <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a>. See the appropriate links for more details.</p>
            <p>The configuration of the node lets you choose the size of a sample to display and to enable certain controls, 
            which are then available in the view. This includes the ability to choose different font sizes or the possibility 
            to set a title. Enabling or disabling these controls via the configuration dialog might not seem useful at 
            first glance but has benefits when used in a web portal/wizard execution where the end user has no access to the 
            workflow itself.</p>
            <p>Since missing values cannot be displayed in the view, they will be omitted with a corresponding warning message.</p>
            <p>Additionally a static SVG image can be rendered, which is then made available at the image output port.</p>

        <tab name="Options">
        	<description>This tab contains all general options for controlling the generation and output of the view.</description>
        	<option name="Number of words to display">
        		Use this numerical value to restrict the number of words used for this visualization.
        		A warning message can be displayed if the number of words in the input table exceeds this value.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Display warnings in view">
        		If checked, warning messages will be displayed in the view when they occur.
        		This could contain information about missing values, exceeding word count, limited layout space, etc.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Report on missing values">
        		Missing values in the selected word or size column lead to the omission of the corresponding row. If this
        		option is checked and missing values are encountered a warning is issued, the rows are silently ignored otherwise.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Create image at outport">
        		If an image is supposed to be rendered during execute for the image outport. 
        		Disable this option if image is not needed or creation is too time consuming.
        		In this case the outport will be disabled.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Title" optional="true">
        		The title of the visualization shown above the generated word cloud. If left blank, no title will be shown.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Subtitle" optional="true">
        		The subtitle of the visualization shown above the generated word cloud. If left blank, no subtitle will be shown.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Word column">
        		Defines the column that contains the string values for the words to display.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Size column" optional="true">
        		Defines the column that contains the numerical size values for the words to display.
        		This can be also set to <i>'&lt;none&gt;'</i>, in which case the size property for the individual row is used.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Use row size property">
        		In case no size column is used the size property for each row is extracted as a size measure for the words.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Width of view/image">
        		Static width of view and generated image. If 'resize view to fill window' is used, this value has no effect.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Height of view/image">
        		Static height of view and generated image. If 'resize view to fill window' is used, this value has no effect.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Resize view to fill window">
        		Setting this option resizes the view and image to the available area of the window. 
        		If disabled the view size is static according to the set width and height.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Display full screen button">
        		Displays a button enabling full screen mode.
        	</option>
        </tab>
        <tab name="Display">
        	<description>This tab contains specific display settings which control the font and layout of the words in the view.</description>
        	<option name="Font family">
        		A font family string, which is used to render the words. Values can be comma separated for fallback declaration.
        		E.g. <i>'Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif'</i>.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Font scale">
        		The font sizes are calculated as an interpolation between specified minimum and maximum font size. There is four
        		interpolation methods to choose from:
        		<ul>
        			<li>linear</li>
        			<li>logarithmic</li>
        			<li>square root</li>
        			<li>exponential</li>
        		</ul>
        		Depending on the size distribution in the data and the desired layout one or another 
        		interpolation method might be more fitting. 
        	</option>
        	<option name="Minimum and maximum font size">
        		Specification for the minimum and maximum font size of the rendered words. Please note that if the values
        		are too large for all words to fit in the designated view area, words might be omitted from the layout or overlap.
        		In this case a warning is displayed in the view.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Use bold font face">
        		Check to use a bold variant of the selected font family for display.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Use row color property">
        		If checked the color property for each word is extracted from the input table. Use a 'Color Manager' to assign
        		colors to the data in advance. If not checked colors are drawn from a default color scale. 
        	</option>
        	<option name="Spiral type">
        		Defines the type of spiral used to position the words. There is two types to choose from:
        		<ul>
        			<li>archimedean</li>
        			<li>rectangular</li>
        		</ul>
        	</option>
        	<option name="Number of orientations">
        		Numerical value for the number of orientations which are assigned randomly to words. The rotation angles are
        		calculated according to the specified start and end angle with the number of orientations taken into account.
        		E.g. to create a strict perpendicular layout set the number to 2, with the start angle at -90&#176; and the
        		end angle at 0&#176;. By default there is 5 orientations between -60&#176; and +60&#176;, which results in the
        		following set of orientations: [-60&#176;, -30&#176;, 0&#176;, +30&#176; +60&#176;].
        	</option>
        	<option name="Start and end angle">
        		Numerical values for start and end angle of orientations. The values need to be in the range from -90&#176; to +90&#176;.
        		See 'number of orientations' for more details.
        	</option>
        	<option name="Display refresh button">
        		Displays a button to refresh the word cloud layout with the current settings. As the orientation and placement
        		of words have a random component, the layout will look different every time. To achieve a desired look or
        		placement of certain key words, etc. this button can be pressed multiple times. When the view's value is
        		applied the last layout is remembered for image creation and subsequent opening of the view.  
        	</option>
        	<option name="Disable animations">
        		If checked all view animations will be disabled.
        	</option>
