 * Load legacy code that works by defining variables on the global namespace

 * @param {String} varName (optional) The name of the global variable to return.
 * @return {Object} If more than one global variable is created, the `varName` argument is required, and the loader uses
 *     it to determine the object to return. Otherwise this loader returns the value of the only global object created.
 * For example, if a script reads `foo = o1; bar = o2;`, then `requireLegacy('script', 'foo')` will return `o1`, and
 * `requireLegacy('script', 'bar')` will return `o2`.
 * If the script contains only `foo = o1`, then `requireLegacy('script')` will return `1`;
